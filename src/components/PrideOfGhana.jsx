                Modernize Ghana through highlife, a culture in which
                sound and rhythm organize collective life.

                <p className='mb-[20px]'>Nkrumah, who best understood highlife’s critical 
                potential to set a modernizing beat, turned his 
                attention to culture. Recognizing the power of 
                highlife to influence the population, particularly 
                urban youth. Declaring that highlife was Ghana’s 
                “national” dance music and that it, as well as 
                stating that the country’s popular music scene 
                needed to become more “Ghanaian” in composition 
                and character.</p>

                celebrate the Pride of Highlife soundtrack to 
                everyday life, awakening parts of the Ghanaian
